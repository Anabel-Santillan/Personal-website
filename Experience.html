            I participated in FIRST Robotics Competition's for four years which inspired me to ultimately pursue a tech-related job. FIRST Robotics culture cultivates leadership, teamwork, community
            service, creativity, STEM, and engineering. Robotics was some of the highlights of my high school years; I met some of my best friends in robotics and was exposed to
            the construction of the robot. If you're interested in learning or exploring more about FIRST, click <a href = "https://www.firstinspires.org/about/vision-and-mission">here</a>
            to further explore their mission statements or more about them.

            I worked at C2MG builders for about a year after graduating from North Bennet Street School with a degree in carpentry. C2MG is a high-end custom home building
            company, so I was fortunate enough to work on very special and unique carpentry. A fun part of this job was that I never knew what was coming the next day. I worked all over the
            Eastern part of Massachusetts working on various jobs. Carpentry was an experience that taught me a lot of teamwork, attention to detail, and accountability. One of 
            the company's signature phrases was "lead by serving", working here helped me grow a lot as a young person.
