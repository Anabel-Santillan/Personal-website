      <p class = "childhood">Being 21 years old means that technology has always been in my life, so my 
        interest began early. This interest originally manifested with video games
        on my Nintendo DS, but quickly escalated. I was fortunate enough to grow up during a time when
        technology was advancing extremely quickly. During high school I was on the FIRST Robotics team
        Team 5000 and during my years in the club we qualified and competed in the regional competition
        for the first time in the high school's history. During my time in robotics I volunteered
        to teach after school programs to young elementary school students including building and coding
        using the Lego Robotics kits.

        I've always been a natural leader, and I enjoy working in teams rather than alone. I thrive in team 
        environments, and enjoy taking time to teach people. I'm an avid problem solver and I love building
        and experimenting. I believe learning is a life long commitment and skill that is one of the best tools
        anyone can have in their toolkit.

        In my free time I love solving puzzles, learning new things, playing video games and watching anime!

        Currently, I'm completing a software engineering apprenticeship with Multiverse. My apprenticeship
        is with Citizens as a Data Engineer for the Data Lake Management team. So far, I'm loving the experience
        and I'm so glad that I decided to take the risk and explore this further!
